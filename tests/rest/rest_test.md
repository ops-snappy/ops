### Setup

#### Topology diagram
```ditaa
+----------------+         +----------------+
|                |         |                |
|                |         |                |

+----------------+         +----------------+
```

For testing purposes, a fixture function is executed for all tests described,
to obtain base test data from the default port and create a test port. This
base test data and test port are used later on each test to either create
another test port, or attempt to delete or modify the test port. The setup
steps for this are as follows:

1. Query the default port `/rest/v1/system/ports/bridge_normal` and save the
result as the base port data, to be available for all tests.
2. Modify the base port data, changing the port's name to `test_port`, and
create a new port with this data.
3. Upon test finalization, using the fixture's finalizer function, the test
port is deleted.

### Description

This test validates that REST methods (`GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, and
`DELETE`) are restricted based on the user's permissions. Currently there are
only two permissions that allow a user to login and use REST: `READ_SWITCH_CONFIG`
and `WRITE_SWITCH_CONFIG`. These permissions map to REST methods as follows:

- `READ_SWITCH_CONFIG`: `GET`
- `WRITE_SWITCH_CONFIG`: `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, `DELETE`

So, for example, if a user does not have the `WRITE_SWITCH_CONFIG`, they can't
execute a POST operation.

The following tests are performed while the default user `netop` is logged in:

1. Verify if the user can execute a POST command.
    a. Execute a POST command over `/rest/v1/system/ports`, using the base port
    data and naming the port `my_test_port`.
    b. Verify if the HTTP response is `201 CREATED`.

2. Verify if the user can execute a PUT command.
    a. Execute a PUT command over `/rest/v1/system/ports/test_port`, adding a
    `test` key with value `test` to the `other_config` column.
    b. Verify if the HTTP response is `200 OK`.

3. Verify if the user can execute a PATCH command.
    a. Execute a PATCH command over `/rest/v1/system/ports/test_port`, using
    the following PATCH data:

    ```
        [{"op": "add", "path": "/other_config", "value": {}},
         {"op": "add", path": "/other_config/patch_test", "value": "test"}]
    ```

    b. Verify if the HTTP response is `204 NO CONTENT`.

4. Verify if the user can execute a GET command.
    a. Execute a GET command over `/rest/v1/system/ports/test_port`.
    b. Verify if the HTTP response is `200 OK`.

5. Verify if the user can execute a DELETE command.
    a. Execute a DELETE command over `/rest/v1/system/ports/test_port`.
    b. Verify if the HTTP response is `204 NO CONTENT`.

6. Verify if the user can execute a GET command for the full-configuration
   resource.
    a. Execute a GET command over `/rest/v1/system/full-configuration`.
    b. Verify if the HTTP response is `200 OK`.

7. Verify if the user can execute a PUT command for the full-configuration
   resource.
    a. Execute a PUT command over `/rest/v1/system/full-configuration`, using
    the following data:

    ```
        {
            "System": {
                "hostname": "",
                "asset_tag_number": ""
            }
        }
    ```

    b. Verify if the HTTP response is `200 OK`.

8. Verify if the user can execute a GET command for the logs resource.
    a. Execute a GET command over `/rest/v1/logs`.
    b. Verify if the HTTP response is `200 OK`.

The following tests are intended to test the restriction of REST's methods
based on lack of permissions, while the `admin` user is logged in. However,
currently, REST allows authentication only for users with `READ_SWITCH_CONFIG`
and `WRITE_SWITCH_CONFIG` permissions; at the time of this writing, the only
user with either of these permissions is `netop`, which actually has both, so
you can't essentially test that a user without one of them can't execute a
method not allowed by the permission. Therefore, these tests are disabled in
production. In order to test the restriction is actually working, you have to
build a version of REST that would allow the `admin` user to authenticate (i.e.
by adding `SYS_MGMT` to the list of allowed permissions to login), re-enable
these tests, and run them locally, as the `admin` user does not currently have
either of the allowed permissions for executing REST methods. This is necessary
until there exists, by default, a user that would be allowed to authenticate
while having a different set of permissions that serves testing purposes.

+----------------+         +----------------+
```

### Description

This test case validates REST's `/account` resource's ability to change the
currently logged in user's password, through a PUT request, and query their
role and permissions, through a GET request.
Unless otherwise stated, the default user `netop` (password: `netop`) is logged
in, and the correct Cookie header is used for each request.

1. Verify the user can't change their own password when supplying a wrong
   current password.
    a. Execute a PUT request over `/account`, supplying an incorrect current
    password in the request body:

    ```
        {
            "configuration":
            {
                "password": "wrongpassword",
                "new_password": "newpassword"
            }
        }
    ```

    b. Verify if the HTTP status code is `401 UNAUTHORIZED`.

2. Verify the user can't change their own password when not supplying their
   current password.
    a. Execute a PUT request over `/account`, omitting the current password in
    the request body:

    ```
        {
            "configuration":
            {
                "new_password": "newpassword"
            }
        }
    ```

    b. Verify if the HTTP status code is `400 BAD REQUEST`.

3. Verify the user can't change their own password when not supplying a new
   password.
    a. Execute a PUT request over `/account`, omitting the new password in the
    request body:

    ```
        {
            "configuration":
            {
                "password": "netop"
            }
        }
    ```

    b. Verify if the HTTP status code is `400 BAD REQUEST`.

4. Verify the user can't change their own password when not logged in.
    a. Execute a PUT request over `/account`, without supplying a Cookie header,
    using the following data:

    ```
        {
            "configuration":
            {
                "password": "netop",
                "new_password": "newpassword"
            }
        }
    ```

    b. Verify if the HTTP status code is `401 UNAUTHORIZED`.

5. Verify a successful password change for the currently logged in user.
    a. Execute a PUT request over `/account`, using the following data:

    ```
        {
            "configuration":
            {
                "password": "netop",
                "new_password": "newpassword"
            }
        }
    ```

    b. Verify if the HTTP status code is `200 OK`.
    c. Using the cookie header from the PUT request, execute a GET request over
    `/account`
    d. Verify if the HTTP status code is `200 OK`

6. Verify the user's role and permissions can be queried while logged in.
    a. Execute a GET request over `/account`.
    b. Verify if the HTTP status code is `200 OK`
    c. Verify if the user's role is present in the response and it corresponds
    to `ops_netop`.
    d. Verify if the user's permissions are present in the response and that
    they include `READ_SWITCH_CONFIG` and `WRITE_SWITCH_CONFIG` permissions.

7. Verify the user's role and permission can't be queried while not logged in.
    a. Execute a GET request over `account`, without supplying a Cookie header.
    b. Verify if the HTTP status code is `401 UNAUTHORIZED`.

### Test result criteria

|                |         |                |
+----------------+         +----------------+
```

#### Test setup

**Switch 1** has bridge_normal configure by default.
**Switch 1** a test VLAN has to be addded with the following configuration:

```
{
    "configuration": {
        "name": "test",
        "id": 1,
        "description": "test_vlan",
        "admin": ["up"],
        "other_config": {},
        "external_ids": {}
    }
}
```

Add a VLAN with the following data:
```
{
    "configuration": {
        "name": "VLAN2",
        "id": 2,
        "description": "test_vlan",
        "admin": ["up"],
        "other_config": {},
        "external_ids": {}
    }
}
```

### Description
Verify if the VLAN is not deleted using If-Match header with a not matching Etag.
 1. Execute a GET request over `/rest/v1/system/bridges/bridge_normal/vlans/test?selector=configuration`.
 2. Read Etag header field provided by the server.
 3. Change the Etag value read at step 2.
 4. Execute DELETE request over `/rest/v1/system/bridges/bridge_normal/vlans/test?selector=configuration` and include the If-Match Header using the Etag read at step 3.
 5. Verify if the HTTP response is `412 Precondition Failed`.

### Test result criteria
#### Test pass criteria

This test passes by meeting the following criteria:

A `412 Precondition Failed` HTTP response.

#### Test fail criteria

This test fails when the HTTP response is not equal to `412 Precondition Failed`.

## Declarative configuration schema validations
### Objective
The test case verifies that the schema validations for the declarative configuration including incorrect data type, out of range, missing mandatory field, and invalid reference checking prevents invalid configurations from reaching the database.

### Requirements

Physical or virtual switches are required for this test.

        }
    },
    "System": {

                "datapath_type": "",
                "name": "bridge_normal",
                "ports": [
                    "p1"
                ]
            }
        },
        "hostname": "ops",
        "vrfs": {
            "vrf_default": {
                "name": "vrf_default"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

**Invalid Configuration**

```
{
    "Interface": {
        "49": {
            "name": 1,
            "type": "system"
        }
    },

        "bridges": {
            "bridge_normal": {
                "datapath_type": "",
                "name": "bridge_normal",
                "ports": [
                    "p2"
                ]
            }
        },
        "vrfs": {
            "vrf_default": {
                "name": "vrf_default"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Description
The valid configuration confirms that the schema validations are not returning false positives. The invalid configuration is a modified version of the valid configuration for confirming that the different types of validations detect issues including incorrect data types, out of range values, missing mandatory fields, and invalid references. Schema validations are verified by performing the following steps:

1. Send a PUT request with the valid configurations to the `/rest/v1/system/full-configuration?type=running` path.
2. Verify that the request was successful by confirming that the return code is equal to `200`.
3. Confirm that the schema validations are verifying the data by attempting to send a PUT request to the `/rest/v1/system/full-configuration?type=running` path by using the invalid data. The invalid data removes the mandatory field `hostname` from `System`, sets an invalid reference in `bridge_normal` to `p2`, changes the type of the `name` field in interface `49`, and sets an out-of-range value for `trunks` for port `p1`.
4. Verify that the request was not successful by confirming that the return code is not equal to `200`.
5. To confirm that the error response is triggered by schema validations, verify that it contains an error message for each field with an invalid value in the response data.

### Test result criteria
#### Test pass criteria
The test case is considered passing if the PUT request using the valid data is successful and fails the second PUT request attempt using the invalid data. The response data must include an `error` field and an associated error message for each field.

#### Test fail criteria
The test is considered failing if the PUT request using the invalid data is successful. A successful response indicates that the schema validations did not detect errors in the data.

## Custom validators
### Objective
This test case verifies that the custom validation framework invokes an implemented custom validator upon a POST request and also returns any issues.

### Requirements

- Physical or virtual switches
- `bgp_router.py` custom validator

The `bgp_router.py` is located in the `opsplugins` directory of the `ops-quagga` repository.

### Setup
#### Topology diagram

```ditaa
    +----------------+         +----------------+
    |                |         |                |
    |                |         |                |
    |      Host      +---------+     Switch     |

    +----------------+         +----------------+
```

#### Test Setup
Two BGP configurations are used for verifying the REST custom validations. The first BGP router configuration is used for the valid test case, and the second BGP router configuration is used for the invalid test case. The following configurations are used for testing REST custom validators:

**BGP Router 1 configuration for valid test caes**

```
{
    "configuration": {
        "always_compare_med": True,
        "asn": 6001
    }
}
```

**BGP Router 2 configuration for invalid test case**

```
{
    "configuration": {
        "always_compare_med": True,
        "asn": 6002
    }
}
```

Two configurations are used for verifying the declarative configuration custom validations. The first configuration is a full valid configuration, and the second configuration includes an invalid amount of BGP routers. Similar to the REST custom validation test, the DC test also tests BGP router configurations. The following configurations are used in the valid and invalid test cases:

**Valid Declarative Configuration**

            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Description
To verify that the custom validation framework invokes the custom validator for the BGP router resource, the BGP router validator responsible for checking the number of BGP routers will return an error response that also includes an error code. For the BGP router table, only one BGP router is permitted. The following steps verify the custom validation framework using REST:

1. Create a BGP router by sending BGP router 1 configurations as data in a POST request to the path `/rest/v1/system/vrfs/vrf_default/bgp_routers`.
2. Verify that the request was successful by confirming that the return code is equal to `201`.
3. Confirm the validator works by attempting to create another BGP router with a different ASN using BGP router 2 configurations as data sent in another POST request to the `/rest/v1/system/vrfs/vrf_default/bgp_routers` path.
4. Verify that the request was not successful by confirming that the return code is not equal to `201`.
5. To confirm that the error response was triggered by the custom validator, verify from the response data that it contains a `code` field.

The declarative custom validation is verified by the following steps:

1. Send a PUT request using the valid DC configuration to the path `/rest/v1/system/full-configuration?type=running`.
2. Verify that the request was successful by confirming that the return code is equal to `200`.
3. Confirm the validator works by attempting to configure two BGP routers in the declarative configuration using the invalid configuration.
4. Verify that the request was not successful by confirming that the return code is not equal to `200`.
5. To confirm that the error response was triggered by the custom validator, verify from the response data that it contains a `code` field.

### Test result criteria
#### Test pass criteria
For REST, the test case is considered passing if the request for creating the first BGP router is successful and fails the attempt to create a second BGP router with a different ASN. The response data must include an `error` field and an associated `code`. For the declarative configuration, the test is considered passing when the configuration includes two BGP routers and results in an error response prohibiting the configuration from being applied.

#### Test fail criteria
For REST, the test case is considered failing if the second request to create another BGP router is successful. A successful response indicates that the custom validation framework did not invoke the custom validator for the BGP router. Similarly, for the declarative configuration, the test case is considered failing if a successful response is received when configuring the invalid configuration.

## HTTPS support
All REST APIs use the HTTPS protocol to send requests to the REST server. The HTTPS protocol requires the SSL certificate and the private key for authentication of the REST server. It also provides encryption of the data exchanged.
The REST server by default uses a self-signed SSL certificate for this purpose. All of the REST test scripts use the same SSL certificate for testing purpose. The above tests are all modified to send an HTTPS request to the REST server. REST test scripts currently use two different test frameworks:`ops-vsi` and `ops-ft-framework`. The `ops-ft-framework` framework creates a virtual host running a generic Ubuntu image, which uses Python 2.7.6. The following change has been added to `ops-ft-framework` to set up an HTTPS connection with the REST server.

```ditaa
import ssl
import httplib
headers = {"Content-type": "application/json", "Accept": "text/plain"}
url = '/rest/v1/system/ports'
conn = httplib.HTTPSConnection(server_ip, 443, cert_file="/root/restEnv/server.crt", key_file="/root/restEnv/server.key")
conn.request('GET', url, None, headers)
response = conn.getresponse()

```

Scripts, using the `ops-vsi` framework run Python 2.7.9, introduces the SSL context. The following change is added in the library function to set up an HTTPS connection with the REST server. As this is a self-signed certificate, hostname is not being used. Hence, the `check_hostname` flag is set to false. For certificates obtained from a trusted certificate authority (CA), the `check_hostname flag` must be set to true.

```ditaa
import ssl
import httplib
headers = {"Content-type": "application/json", "Accept": "text/plain"}
sslcontext = ssl.SSLContext(ssl.PROTOCOL_SSLv23)
sslcontext.verify_mode = ssl.CERT_REQUIRED
sslcontext.check_hostname = False
src_path = os.path.dirname(os.path.realpath(__file__))
src_file = os.path.join(src_path, 'server.crt')
sslcontext.load_verify_locations(src_file)
url = '/rest/v1/system/ports'
conn = httplib.HTTPSConnection(server_ip, 443, context=sslcontext)
conn.request('GET', url, None, headers)
response = conn.getresponse()

```

    ```
        [{"op": "add", "path": "/nonexistent_path", "value": "bridge"}]
    ```
    b. Verify if the HTTP response is `400 BAD REQUEST`.
    c. Validate that Auditlog registered the event.

### Test result criteria
#### Test pass criteria
For REST, the test case is considered passing if Auditlog registers all
events except for GET requests with the proper values, such as: type of
event, type of operation, REST user, HOST address and result(success or failed).

#### Test fail criteria
For REST, the test case is considered fail if Auditlog do not registers the
events for CREATE, PUT, PATCH and DELETE requests with the proper values,
such as: type of event, type of operation, REST user, HOST address and result
(success or failed).

### Test result criteria
#### Test pass criteria
- The first GET test passes, if the REST API for LOGS with both offset and
  limit returns HTTP method `200 OK`. Length of  the response should be less
  than or equal to the limit filter used in the URI.
- The second GET test passes if the REST API for LOGS with limit as None
  returns HTTP method `200OK`. Length of the response should be difference
  between length of the data and offset number.

  returns HTTP method `200OK`. Length of the response should be less than or
  equal to the limit filter.
- The fourth  GET test passes if the REST API for LOGS with negative limit
  returns HTTP method `400 BAD REQUEST`.
- The fifth  GET test passes if the REST API for LOGS with negative offset
  returns HTTP method `400 BAD REQUEST`.


#### Test fail criteria
- The first test fails if the REST API method does not return HTTP code
  `200 OK` for the URI `/rest/v1/logs?ofset=<>&limit=<>` or length of the
  response is more than the limit parameter used.
- The second test fails if the REST API method does not return HTTP code
  `200 OK` for the URI `/rest/v1/logs?offset=<>` or length of response is more
  than the difference between length of data and offset number used.

  `200 OK` for the URI `/rest/v1/logs?limit=<>` or length of response is more
  than the the limit parameter used.
- The fourth  GET test fails if the REST API for LOGS with negative limit does
  not return HTTP method `400 BAD REQUEST`.
- The fifth  GET test passes if the REST API for LOGS with negative offset
  does not return HTTP method `400 BAD REQUEST`.
