## Definition of terms
| Term | Description |
|:-----------|:---------------------------------------|
| **Class** | For networking, a set of packets sharing some common characteristic (e.g all IPv4 packets) |
| **Codepoint**| Used in two different ways -- either as the name of a packet header field or as the name of the values carried within a packet header field: *Example 1: Priority Code Point (PCP) is the name of a field in the [IEEE 802.1Q](http://www.ieee802.org/1/pages/802.1Q.html) VLAN tag. Example 2: Differentiated Services codepoint (DSCP) is the name of values carried within the DS field of the header field.*
| **Color** | A meta-data label associated with each packet within the switch with three values: "green", "yellow", or "red". It is used by the switch when packets encounter congestion for resource (queue) to distinguish which packets should be dropped It is used by the switch when packets encounter congestion for resource (queue) to distinguish which packets should be dropped. |
| **Class of Service (CoS)** | A 3-bit value used to mark packets with one of eight classes (levels of priority). It is carried within the Priority Code Point (PCP) field of the [IEEE 802.1Q](http://www.ieee802.org/1/pages/802.1Q.html) VLAN tag. |
| **Differentiated Services codepoint (DSCP)** | A 6-bit value used to mark packets for different per-hop behavior as originally defined by [IETF RFC 2474](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2474). It is carried within the Differentiated Services (DS) field of the IPv4 or IPv6 header. |
| **Local-priority** | A meta-data label associated with a packet within a network switch. It is used by the switch to distinguish packets for different treatment (e.g. queue assignment, etc). |
| **Meta-data** | Information labels associated with each packet in the switch separate from the packet headers and data. These labels are used by the switch in its handling of the packet. Examples are: arrival port, egress port, VLAN membership, local priority, color, etc. |
| **Priority Code Point (PCP)** | The name of a 3-bit field in the [IEEE 802.1Q](http://www.ieee802.org/1/pages/802.1Q.html) VLAN tag. It carries the CoS value to mark a packet with one of 8 classes (priority levels). |
| **Quality of Service (QoS)** | General term used when describing or measuring performance. For networking, it means how different classes of packets are treated across the network or device. For more information, see [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_service). |
| **Traffic class (TC)** | General term for a set of packets sharing some common characteristic. It used to be the name of an 8-bit field in the IPv6 header originally defined by [IETF RFC 2460](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2460#section-7). This field name was changed to Differentiated Services by [IETF RFC 2474](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2474). |
| **Type of Service (ToS)** | General term when there are different levels of treatment (e.g. fare class).  It used to be the name of an 8-bit field in the IPv4 header originally defined by [IETF RFC 791](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc791). This field name was changed to Differentiated Services by [IETF RFC 2474](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2474)|


## QoS global configuration commands

These commands are entered in the global configuration context.

## apply qos

#### Syntax

`apply qos queue-profile <NAME> schedule-profile {<NAME> | strict}`

#### Description
The **apply qos** command in the global configuration context will configure the given queue profile and schedule profile at the global level.  Global profiles are configured on all Ethernet interfaces and LAGs that have not applied their own profiles.

**This may cause the interface(s) or LAG(s) to shut down briefly during the reconfiguration.**

For a queue profile to be complete and ready to be applied, all local priorities must be mapped to some queue.

For the schedule profile to be complete and ready to be applied, it must have configuration for each queue defined by the queue profile. All queues must use the same algorithm except for the highest numbered queue, which may be 'strict'.

There is a special, pre-defined schedule-profile named 'strict'.  It is always present and unalterable.  This 'strict' profile will service all queues of an associated queue profile using the strict priority algorithm.

The queue profile and the schedule profile must both specify the same number of queues.

An applied profile cannot be updated or deleted until such time that it is no longer applied.

The **no apply qos** command is disallowed in the global configuration context.  It is required to always have a global and schedule profile applied.  To cease the use of a profile, apply a different profile.

#### Authority
All configuration users.

#### Parameters
| Parameter | Description |
|:-----------|:---------------------------------------|
| *NAME* | The name of the profile to apply
| *strict* | Use the strict schedule profile

#### Examples
```
switch# configure terminal
switch(config)# apply qos queue-profile default schedule-profile strict
```

#### Troubleshooting
See the [Common troubleshooting](#common-troubleshooting) section for error messages that may appear as the output of various commands.

| Error Message | Description |
|:-----------|:---------------------------------------|
| *The queue profile has local priority NUM assigned more than once.* | This error message occurs when an apply command is attempted for a queue profile for which the given local priority has been assigned to more than one queue. The solution is to remove the local priority from one of the queues in the queue profile.
| *The queue profile and the schedule profile cannot contain different queues.* | This error message occurs when an apply command is attempted for a queue profile and a schedule profile that have different queues configured. The solution is to add or remove queues from the queue profile or the schedule profile until they both have the same queues configured.
| *The queue profile and the schedule profile applied on port NUM cannot contain different queues.* | This error message occurs when an apply command is attempted for a queue profile that has a different number of queues than a schedule profile that is currently applied at the port level. The solution is to remove the port schedule profile override for the given port, or to modify the queue profile such that it has the same number of queues as the port schedule profile.
| *Profile NAME does not exist.* | This error can occur if an apply command is attempted for a queue profile or a schedule profile that does not exist. The solution is to create the missing queue profile or schedule profile.
| *The schedule profile must have the same algorithm assigned to each queue.* | This error can occur if an apply command is attempted for a schedule profile that does not have the same algorithm assigned to every queue. The solution is to change the algorithm assigned to each queue until all queues have the same algorithm assigned. The exception is that the highest priority queue is always allowed to be assigned the strict algorithm.

## qos cos-map

#### Syntax
`qos cos-map <0-7> local-priority <NUM> [color <COLOR>] [name <DESCRIPTION>]`
`no qos cos-map <0-7>`

#### Description
The **cos-map** command associates local-priority, color, and optionally a descriptive name to each 802.1 VLAN priority code point (COS).

This table is used when a port's QoS trust mode is set to 'cos' to mark packets initial local-priority and color (see [qos trust](#qos-trust)).

The default color is "green".  The default name is an empty string.

The **no cos-map** command will restore the assignments for a priority code point back to its factory default.

#### Authority
All configuration users.

#### Parameters
| Parameter | Description |
|:-----------|:---------------------------------------|
| *COS* |  802.1 VLAN Priority Code Point from 0 to 7

```

## qos dscp-map

#### Syntax
`qos dscp-map <0-63> local-priority <NUM> [color <COLOR>] [name <DESCRIPTION>]`
`no qos dscp-map <0-63>`

#### Description
The **dscp-map** command associates local-priority, color, and optionally a descriptive name to each IP differentiated services code point (DSCP).  This command can optionally remark the incoming 802.1 VLAN CoS PCP.

This table is used when a port's  QoS trust mode is set to 'dscp' to assign the packets initial local-priority and color.

The default color is 'green'.  The default name is an empty string.

The 'no' form of the command will restore the assignments for a code point back to its factory default.

#### Authority
All configuration users.

#### Parameters
| Parameter | Description |
|:-----------|:---------------------------------------|
| *DSCP* | IP Differentiated Services Code Point from 0 to 63
| *NUM* |  ASIC-specific local priority value from 0 to 7

switch(config)# qos dscp-map 1 local-priority 2 color green name EntryName
```

## qos queue-profile

#### Syntax
`qos queue-profile <NAME>`
`no qos queue-profile <NAME>`

#### Description
The queue-profile command is used to enter the queue-profile configuration context to create, or edit, a named queue profile.

The no form of the command will delete the named queue profile, if it is not currently applied.

##### Default profile

There is a special, pre-defined profile named 'default'.  At installation a factory supplied default queue-profile is automatically applied. The 'default' profile is editable as long as it is not applied.

**show qos queue-profile default** will display current contents of the profile.

The profile named 'default' cannot be deleted. **no queue-profile default** will reset it back to the factory supplied profile.

## qos trust

#### Syntax
`qos trust {none|cos|dscp}`
`no qos trust`

#### Description
The Trust command configures one of three modes that be applied globally on all Ethernet interfaces and LAGs.  The modes determine which of any packet field values are used to assign the initial Local-priority and Color meta-data values to the packet from the CoS or DSCP Map tables.

**no qos trust** will restore the trust mode back to the factory default.

#### Authority
All configuration users.

#### Parameters
| Parameter | Description |
|:-----------|:---------------------------------------|
| none | Ignores all packet headers. The packet is initially assigned local_priority of zero and color of green.
| cos | For 802.1 VLAN tagged packets, use the priority code point field value of the outermost VLAN header as the index into the COS Map. If the packet is untagged, use the meta-data values at index zero of the COS Map.
| dscp | For IP packets, use the DSCP value as the index into the DSCP Map. For non-IP packets with 802.1 VLAN tag(s), use the priority code point field value of the outermost tag header as the index into the CoS Map.  For untagged, non-IP packets, use the meta-data values at index zero of the CoS Map.

#### Examples
```
switch# configure terminal
switch(config)# qos trust dscp
```

## QoS interface configuration commands

These commands are entered in the interface configuration context.

## interface apply qos

#### Syntax

`(config-if)# apply qos schedule-profile {<NAME> | strict}`
`(config-if)# no apply qos schedule-profile`

#### Description
The **apply qos** command in the Ethernet or LAG interface configuration context will configure the given schedule profile just for that interface.  It will override any schedule-profile applied in the global context.

**This may cause the interface (or LAG) to shutdown briefly during the reconfiguration.**

**NOTE:** The same name as the currently applied schedule-profile can be applied in the global context. This guarantees that the interface will always use this schedule-profile, even when the global context schedule-profile subsequently changes.

For the schedule profile to be complete and ready to be applied, it must have configuration for each queue defined by the queue profile.  All queues must use the same algorithm (such as DWRR, for example), except for the highest numbered queue, which may be 'strict'.

An applied profile cannot be updated or deleted until it is no longer applied.

##### Strict schedule profile
There is a special, pre-defined profile named 'strict'.  It is always present and unalterable.  The strict profile will service all queues of an associated queue profile using strict priority scheduling.

The **no apply qos schedule-profile** command will clear a schedule profile override for a given interface and the interface will use the global schedule profile.  This is the only way to remove a schedule-profile override from the interface.

#### Authority
All configuration users.

#### Parameters
| Parameter | Description |
|:-----------|:---------------------------------------|
| *NAME* | The name of the profile to apply
| *strict* | Use the strict schedule profile

#### Examples
```
switch# configure terminal
switch(config)# interface 1
switch(config-if)# apply qos schedule-profile strict
```

#### Troubleshooting
See the [Common troubleshooting](#common-troubleshooting) section for error messages that may appear as the output of various commands.

| Error Message | Description |
|:-----------|:---------------------------------------|
| *The queue profile and the schedule profile cannot contain different queues.* | This error message occurs when an apply command is attempted for a queue profile and a schedule profile that have different queues configured. The solution is to add or remove queues from the queue profile or the schedule profile until they both have the same queues configured.
| *Profile NAME does not exist.* | This error can occur if an apply command is attempted for a queue profile or a schedule profile that does not exist. The solution is to create the missing queue profile or schedule profile.
| *The schedule profile must have the same algorithm assigned to each queue.* | This error can occur if an apply command is attempted for a schedule profile that does not have the same algorithm assigned to every queue. The solution is to change the algorithm assigned to each queue until all queues have the same algorithm assigned. The exception is that the highest priority queue is always allowed to be assigned the strict algorithm.

## interface qos dscp

#### Syntax

`(config-if)# qos dscp <0-63>`
`(config-if)# $ no qos dscp`

#### Description
The **qos dscp** command in the Ethernet or LAG interface configuration context will configure a DSCP override just for that interface.  It is only allowed if the interface trust mode is **none**.

Note that if a DSCP override has been configured, and the trust mode is subsequently set to 'cos' or 'dscp', then the DSCP override will be ignored.

The **no qos dscp** command will clear the DSCP override for the interface.

##### For all arriving IPv4 or IPv6 packets:
- Initial local-priority and color meta-data are assigned from the DSCP map entry indexed by the DSCP override value
- Remark the packet's DSCP in IPv4 or IPv6 DS header field with the DSCP override value

##### For all arriving non-IP packets:
- Initial local-priority and color meta-data are assigned from the CoS Map entry index 0
- The CoS of all arriving tagged non-IP packets are unchanged
  - If the packet is subsequently transmitted with a 802.1Q VLAN tag, the PCP field will contain the unchanged CoS

#### Authority
All configuration users.

#### Parameters
| Parameter | Description |
|:-----------|:---------------------------------------|
| *<0-63>* | Index into the DSCP Map

#### Examples
```
switch# configure terminal
switch(config)# qos trust cos
switch(config)# interface 1
switch(config-if)# qos trust none
switch(config-if)# qos dscp 0
```

#### Troubleshooting
See the [Common troubleshooting](#common-troubleshooting) section for error messages that may appear as the output of various commands.

| Error Message | Description |
|:-----------|:---------------------------------------|
| *QoS DSCP override is only allowed if the port trust mode is 'none'.* | This error occurs when a dscp override command is attempted when the port trust mode is 'none'. The solution is to configure the port trust mode to 'none'.

## interface qos trust

#### Syntax

`(config-if)# qos trust {none|cos|dscp}`
`(config-if)# $ no qos trust`

#### Description
The **qos trust** command in the Ethernet or LAG interface configuration context will configure a trust mode override just for that interface.  It will override the trust mode applied in the global context.  The modes determine which of any packet field values are used to assign the initial Local-priority and Color meta-data values to the packet from the CoS or DSCP Map tables.

The **no qos trust** command will clear the trust mode override for a given interface and the interface will use the global schedule profile.  This is the only way to remove a trust mode override from the interface.

#### Authority
All configuration users.

#### Parameters
| Parameter | Description |
|:-----------|:---------------------------------------|
| none | Ignores all packet headers. The packet is initially assigned local_priority of zero and color of green.
| cos | For 802.1 VLAN tagged packets, use the priority code point field value of the outermost VLAN header as the index into the COS Map. If the packet is untagged, use the meta-data values at index zero of the COS Map.
| dscp | For IP packets, use the DSCP value as the index into the DSCP Map. For non-IP packets with 802.1 VLAN tag(s), use the priority code point field value of the outermost tag header as the index into the CoS Map.  For untagged, non-IP packets, use the meta-data values at index zero of the CoS Map.

#### Examples
```
switch# configure terminal
switch(config)# interface 1
switch(config-if)# qos trust dscp
```

## QOS queue profile configuration commands

To enter the queue profile context, enter the [qos queue-profile](#qos-queue-profile) command. The following commands are available in queue profile context:
- name
- map

##### Queue numbering

Queues are numbered consecutively starting from zero.  Queue zero is the lowest priority queue.  The larger the queue number, the higher priority the queue has in scheduling algorithms (see [QOS Schedule Profile Configuration Commands](#qos-schedule-profile-configuration-commands)).  The maximum allowed queue number may vary by  product.  For products supporting 8 queues, the largest queue number is 7. Please refer to the product specifications for the maximum.

##### Default profile

There is a special, pre-defined profile named 'default'.  At installation a factory supplied default queue-profile is automatically applied. The 'default' profile is editable as long as it is not applied.


## name

#### Syntax
`name queue <0-7> <DESCRIPTION>`
`no name queue <0-7>`

#### Description
The **name** command assigns a descriptive string to a queue number in a queue profile.  It has no effect on the product configuration.

The descriptive string contains up to 64 characters for customer documentation. The allowed characters are alphanumeric, underscore ('_'), hyphen ('-'), and dot ('.').

The **no name** command will delete the name of a queue number in a queue profile.

#### Authority
All configuration users.

#### Parameters
| Parameter | Description |
|:-----------|:---------------------------------------|
| *QUEUE* |  The queue number from 0 to 7
| *DESCRIPTION* |  The  string to assign to the queue number

#### Examples
```
switch# configure terminal
switch(config)# qos queue-profile Profile_Name
switch(config-queue)# name queue 0 Scavenger_and_backup_data
```

#### Troubleshooting
See the [Common troubleshooting](#common-troubleshooting) section for error messages that may appear as the output of various commands.

| Error Message | Description |
|:-----------|:---------------------------------------|
| *Profile NAME does not have queue NUM configured.* | This error occurs when a 'no' command is attempted for a queue that has not yet been configured. The solution is to first configure the queue.

## map

#### Syntax
`map queue <0-7> local-priority <0-7>`
`no map queue <0-7> [local-priority <0-7>]`

#### Description
The **map** command assigns a local priority to a queue number in a queue profile. Packets marked with that local-priority will use the queue.

More than one local-priority can be assigned to use the same queue. A queue without any local-priorities assigned will not be used to store packets.

For a queue profile to be suitable to be applied (see [apply qos](#apply-qos)), all local-priorities must be assigned to some queue in the profile.

The **no map** command will remove the assignment of the local priority from the queue number. If no local priority is provided, then the assignment of all local priorities will be removed from the queue.

#### Authority
All configuration users.

#### Parameters
| Parameter | Description |
|:-----------|:---------------------------------------|
| *QUEUE* |  The queue number from 0 to 7
| *LOCAL_PRIORITY* |  The local priority to add or remove from the queue number

#### Examples
```
switch# configure terminal
switch(config)# qos queue-profile ProfileName
switch(config-queue)# map queue 0 local-priority 1
```

#### Troubleshooting
See the [Common troubleshooting](#common-troubleshooting) section for error messages that may appear as the output of various commands.

| Error Message | Description |
|:-----------|:---------------------------------------|
| *Profile NAME does not have queue NUM configured.* | This error occurs when a 'no' command is attempted for a queue that has not yet been configured. The solution is to first configure the queue.

## QoS schedule profile configuration commands

To enter the schedule profile context, enter the [qos schedule-profile](#qos-schedule-profile) command. The following commands are available in queue profile context:
- strict
- dwrr (deficit weighted round robin)

##### Queue numbering

Queues in a schedule profile are numbered consecutively starting from zero.  Queue zero is the lowest priority queue.  The larger the queue number the higher priority the queue has in scheduling algorithms.  The maximum allowed queue number may vary by  product.  For products supporting 8 queues, the largest queue number is 7. Please refer to the product specifications for the maximum.

##### Allowed forms

There are two allowed forms for schedule profiles:
1. All queues use the same scheduling algorithm (e.g. dwrr)
2. The highest queue number uses Strict Priority and all remaining (lower) queues use the same algorithm (e.g. dwrr).

The second form supports priority scheduling behavior necessary for the [IEFT RFC 3246 Expedited Forwarding](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3246) specification.

##### Default schedule profile

There is a special, pre-defined profile named 'default'.  At installation a factory supplied default schedule-profile is automatically applied. The 'default' profile is editable as long as it is not applied.

##### Strict schedule profile
There is a special, pre-defined profile named 'strict'.  It is always present and unalterable.  The strict profile will service all queues of an associated queue profile using the strict priority algorithm.

## strict

#### Syntax
`strict queue <0-7>`
`no strict queue <0-7>`

#### Description
The **strict** command assigns the strict priority algorithm to a queue. Strict priority will service all packets waiting in a queue before any packets in lower priority queues are serviced.

The **no strict** command will only clear the algorithm for a queue when the algorithm already assigned is Strict Priority.

#### Authority
All configuration users.

#### Parameters
| Parameter | Description |
|:-----------|:---------------------------------------|
| *QUEUE* |  The queue number from 0 to 7

#### Examples
```
switch# configure terminal
switch(config)# qos schedule-profile Profile_1p7q
switch(config-schedule)# strict queue 7
```

#### Troubleshooting
See the [Common troubleshooting](#common-troubleshooting) section for error messages that may appear as the output of various commands.

| Error Message | Description |
|:-----------|:---------------------------------------|
| *Profile NAME does not have queue NUM configured.* | This error occurs when a 'no' command is attempted for a queue that has not yet been configured. The solution is to first configure the queue.

## dwrr

#### Syntax
`dwrr queue <0-7> weight <1-127>`
`no dwrr queue <0-7>`

#### Description
The **dwrr** command assigns the deficit weighted round robin algorithm and its byte weight to a queue.

(Deficit weight round robin will apportion available bandwidth among all non-empty queues in relation to their queue weights. A product will either support deficit weighted round robin or weighted round robin but not both. Please refer to the specifications for the product.

The **no dwrr** command will only clear the algorithm for a queue when the algorithm already assigned is deficit weighted round robin.

#### Authority
All configuration users.

#### Parameters
| Parameter | Description |
|:-----------|:---------------------------------------|
| *QUEUE* |  The queue number from 0 to 7
| *WEIGHT* |  The weight to use for the dwrr scheduling

#### Examples
```
switch# configure terminal
switch(config)# qos schedule-profile ProfileName
switch(config-schedule)# dwrr queue 0 weight 11
switch(config-schedule)# dwrr queue 1 weight 17
```

#### Troubleshooting
See the [Common troubleshooting](#common-troubleshooting) section for error messages that may appear as the output of various commands.

| Error Message | Description |
|:-----------|:---------------------------------------|
| *Profile NAME does not have queue NUM configured.* | This error occurs when a 'no' command is attempted for a queue that has not yet been configured. The solution is to first configure the queue.

## show interface queues

#### Syntax
`show interface <INTERFACE> queues`

#### Description
This command will display statistics from each queue for an interface:
- Number of packets transmitted
- Number of bytes transmitted
- Number of packets that were not transmitted due to an error (for example: queue full)

Queues are numbered consecutively starting from zero.  Queue zero is the lowest priority queue.  The larger the queue number the higher priority the queue has in scheduling algorithms.  The maximum allowed queue number may vary by  product.  For products supporting 8 queues, the largest queue number is 7. Please refer to the product specifications for the maximum.
