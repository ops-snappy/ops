#### Test setup
### Description

Tests that a configured static Link Aggregation can summarize accurate individual interfaces statistics as they change.

To test LAG statistics do the following:
- Create a static LAG on both switches with members being the interfaces that interconnect them
- Configure an access VLAN and set it on the switches host interface and the LAG
- Validate the hosts can reach each other using ping
- For each LAG on each switch, obtain its statistics and verify all counters are the sum of all individual interfaces and its other information (LAG id, mode, aggregated interfaces) matches the expected settings
- On each host initiate iperf UDP servers
- On each host start iperf as client and send traffic for 30 seconds to the other one
- Gather the stats from the LAG interfaces and verify they still compare with the current values reported on each interface


### Test result criteria
#### Test pass criteria
 * The ping between the workstations succeeds.
 * The values reported by LAG statistics correspond with the LAG configuration and the counters with the sum of individual interfaces' counters.

#### Test fail criteria
 * The ping between the workstations fails.
 * The values reported by LAG statistics do not correspond with the LAG configuration and/or the counters with the sum of individual interfaces' counters.

- Validate connectivity using ping
- On each host, initiate an iperf UDP server and then transmit UDP traffic with iperf between each other for 10 seconds
- Repeat first three steps using a different VLAN, a different link between switches, changing the IP addresses of the hosts and transmitting traffic for 15 seconds
- Repeat the previous step with yet another VLAN, different link between switches, hosts' IP address and transmitting traffic for 20 seconds
- Form a static LAG on one of the switches with no members and verify the statistics align with the LAG configuration and all counters are 0
- Repeat as before for every possible combination of ports while checking that the counters are the sum of the statistics from individual interfaces


### Test result criteria

- Repeat first three steps using a different VLAN, a different link between switches, changing the IP addresses of the hosts and transmitting traffic for 15 seconds
- Repeat the previous step with yet another VLAN, different link between switches, hosts' IP address and transmitting traffic for 20 seconds
- Form a static LAG on one of the switches with one interface and verify the statistics align with the LAG configuration and all counters are equal to that of the member
- Delete and recreate the LAG and verify all counters are now in 0, then add a different combination of members and check the statistics counters match the sum of members' values
- Repeat the last step with all possible combination of three interfaces


### Test result criteria
#### Test pass criteria
 * The ping between the workstations succeeds always.
 * The values reported by LAG statistics correspond with the LAG configuration and the counters with the sum of individual interfaces' counters.

#### Test fail criteria
 * The ping between the workstations fails.
 * The values reported by LAG statistics do not correspond with the LAG configuration and/or the counters with the sum of individual interfaces' counters.
